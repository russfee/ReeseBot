# Decisions

- 2026-01-29: Chose Resend for email service. Free tier (100 emails/day) is sufficient, simple API, good developer experience.
- 2026-01-29: Chose Railway for deployment. Supports cron jobs natively, easy Node.js deployment, free tier available.
- 2026-01-29: Chose TypeScript over plain JavaScript. Type safety for environment variables, better IDE support.
